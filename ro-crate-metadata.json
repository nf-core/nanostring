The performed analysis steps include quality control and data normalization.\n\nThe pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!\n\n## Pipeline summary\n\n1. Quality control with NACHO ([`NACHO`](https://github.com/mcanouil/NACHO/))\n2. Perform normalization with NACHO\n3. Create count tables with provided metadata\n4. Present QC for NanoString data ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))\n\n## Pipeline tubemap\n\n![](./assets/nf-core_nanostring_tubemap.png)\n\n## Usage\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how\n> to set-up Nextflow.

Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).\n\nFor more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/nanostring/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/nanostring/parameters).\n\n## Pipeline output\n\nTo see the results of an example test run with a full size dataset refer to the [results](https://nf-co.re/nanostring/results) tab on the nf-core website pipeline page.\nFor more details about the output files and reports, please refer to the\n[output documentation](https://nf-co.re/nanostring/output).\n\n## Credits\n\nnf-core/nanostring was originally written by Peltzer, Alexander & Mohr, Christopher.
